                    Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education system, which fall under the
                    command of the
                    government at three levels: central, state and local. Under various articles of the Indian
                    Constitution and the Right of
                    Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a
                    fundamental right to
                    children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7.5 .

                    Early education in India commenced under the supervision of a guru or preceptor after
                    initiation.[27] The education was
                    delivered through Gurukula. The relationship between Guru and his Shishya (students /diciples) was
                    very important part
                    of the education.[28] Takshasila (in modern-day Pakistan) is one of the example of ancient higher
                    learning institute in
                    India from possibly 8th century BCE, however, it is debatable whether it could be regarded a
                    university or not in modern
                    sense, since teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and
                    there did not seem
                    to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in a Taxila, in contrast to the
                    later Nalanda
                    university in eastern India. Nalanda was the oldest university-system of education in the world in
                    the modern sense of
                    university. There all subjects were taught in Ariano -Páli language.

                    Education in India is a Concurrent List subject, that is both the Indian central government, and the
                    state governments
                    have responsibility for enacting and implementing education policy.[34] The central board and most
                    of the state boards
                    uniformly follow the "10+2" pattern of education.[35]: 3  In this pattern, study of 10 years is done
                    in schools and 2
                    years in Junior colleges (Maharashtra) or Higher Secondary Schools(most other states),[35]: 44  and
                    then 3 years of
                    study for a bachelor's degree.[36] The first 10 years is further subdivided into 8 years of
                    elementary education (5
                    years Primary School and 3 years Middle School), 2 years of Secondary education followed by 2 years
                    of Higher Secondary
                    Schools or Junior colleges.[35]: 5  This pattern originated from the recommendation of the Education
                    Commission of
                    1964–66.[37]
